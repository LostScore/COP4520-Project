# COP4520-Project
Analyzing and attempting to approve BFS by implementing concurrency in the algorithm.

# Compile
to compile the code type in your command line
```
javac run.java
```
to run it type
```
java run.java *integer **integer

*Integer Flag, to change the number of threads tested.
**Intger Flag, to change the index number to do the BFS from 0 - 99;
```
the output of the file is the time in ms for a sequential BFS on the first line and the second is the time in ms for the parralel BFS.
